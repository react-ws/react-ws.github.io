## Introduction

The workshop on Affective Artificial Intelligence (A2I) at ICPR 2024 aims to encourage and highlight state-of-the-art research in affective computing and applications. The key focuses are on novel neural network architectures, incorporating anatomical insights and constraints, introducing new and challenging datasets, and exploiting multi-modal training. 

## Call for Contributions

#### Full Workshop Papers
The workshop topics include (but are not limited to): 

- Large-scale data generation or Inexpensive annotation for Affective Computing
- AI methods for Affective Computing with multimodal data
- Multi-modal method for emotion recognition
- Explainable and/or Privacy Preserving AI in affective computing
- Generative and responsible personalization of affective phenomena estimators with few-shot learning
- Bias in affective computing data (e.g. lack of multi-cultural datasets)
- Semi-/weak-/un-/self- supervised learning methods, domain adaptation methods, and other novel methods for Affective Computing
- Applications in education, entertainment & healthcare 

<br>

We will be accepting the submission of full unpublished and original papers. These papers will be peer-reviewed via a single-blind process. The accepted papers in the workshops will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS), Springer (<a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs" target="_blank">https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs</a>). Please note that it will be published after the workshop.

#### Submission 
We invite authors to submit unpublished papers (15 pages including references <a href="https://icpr2024.org/cfp.html" target="_blank">ICPR format</a>) to our workshop, to be presented at an oral/poster session upon acceptance. All submissions will go through a single-blind review process. All contributions must be submitted (along with supplementary materials, if any) at the <a href = "https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/A2IICPR2024" target="_blank">Microsoft CMT</a>. 

#### Note
Authors of previously rejected main conference submissions are also welcome to submit their work to our workshop. When doing so, you must submit the previous reviewers' comments (named as previous\_reviews.pdf) and a letter of changes (named as letter\_of\_changes.pdf) as part of your supplementary materials to clearly demonstrate the changes made to address the comments made by previous reviewers.
