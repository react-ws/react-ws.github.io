          <Strong>Title:</Strong> Multimodal and Context-Aware Emotion Perception <br>          
          <p align="justify"><Strong>Abstarct:</Strong> Human emotion perception is integral to intelligent systems' wide applications, including behavior prediction, social robotics, medicine, surveillance, and entertainment. Current literature advocates that humans perceive emotions and behavior from various human modalities and situational and background contexts. Our research focuses on this aspect of emotion perception, as we attempt to build emotion perception models from multiple modalities and contextual cues and use such ideas of perception for various real-world domains of AI applications. We will go over both parts in this talk. In the first part, we will explore two approaches to improve emotion perception models. In one approach, we will leverage the idea of using more than one modality to perceive human emotion. In the other approach, we leverage contextual information; background scene, multiple modalities of the human subject, and socio-dynamic inter-agent interactions available in the input to predict the perceived emotion. In the second part, we will explore three domains of AI applications; i) video manipulations and deepfake detection, ii) multimedia content analysis, and iii) social media interactions investigation to enrich solutions with ideas from emotion perception.</p> <br>

         <p align="justify"> <Strong>Title:</Strong> Unravelling the Importance of Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) in Affective Computing </p>
      <p align="justify"> <Strong> Abstract:</Strong> In the rapidly evolving field of affective computing, the integration of Remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) has emerged as an innovative technique for non-invasive physiological monitoring. This keynote addresses the pivotal role of rPPG in advancing our understanding and application of affective computing. Remote Photoplethysmography (or rPPG) is a technique that enables the measurement of blood volume changes in the skin using camera-based systems, providing a contactless method to capture physiological signals such as heart rate and respiratory rate. By analyzing subtle changes in skin colour, rPPG offers a unique window into the autonomic nervous system's responses, making it an invaluable tool for emotion recognition and mental health assessment. This talk will delve into the core principles of rPPG and explore its diverse applications within affective computing. We will examine how rPPG can be utilized to detect facial microexpressions, which are critical for understanding genuine emotional states and enhancing lie detection systems.
<br>
Additionally, we will discuss the application of rPPG in stress detection, providing insights into real-time monitoring of stress levels in various environments, from workplaces to daily life scenarios. Moreover, the keynote will highlight the potential of rPPG in the early detection and monitoring of depression, offering a non-intrusive method to support mental health professionals. We will also explore its use in other domains, such as anxiety detection, fatigue monitoring, and enhancing user experience in human-computer interaction. By unravelling the importance of rPPG in affective computing, this keynote aims to underscore the transformative impact of this technology on both research and practical applications, paving the way for more sophisticated, empathetic, and responsive systems.</p> <br>

His broad research interests include Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Image Processing. He works to make the current technology useful for human beings by analyzing their behavior. He has worked on fusing multiple biometric traits for authentication; analyzing facial expressions using deep learning; measuring the human-vitals (which are, heart rate, breathing rate and blood pressure) using unobtrusive and non-contact human videos; and cross-modal learning. These play indispensable role in security; affective computing; ambient intelligence; and health-care.</p>

    <p align="justify"> <Strong>Title:</Strong> Title: Learning Human Visual Attention and Gaze Communication Behaviours with Applications to Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnosis </p>
      <p align="justify"> <Strong> Abstract:</Strong> Humans employ a complex combination of verbal and non-verbal communication to convey information and express intentions. While the former is extensively used during communication, the latter is just as important. In fact, non-verbal communication such as visual attention and gaze communication behaviours contain a wealth of information about a person’s affective, cognitive and mental states. The limited ability to communicate effectively hinders knowledge acquisition and are noticeable in mental health disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). There are currently no medical tests that diagnose ASD. Instead, clinicians employ a combination of a comprehensive analysis of developmental history and manual observation of atypical behaviours to diagnose a patient. It is vital to develop new diagnostic methods to ensure that early interventions are provided to optimise health outcomes. In this talk, I will outline our work on developing computational models that aim to mimic and/or quantify visual attention and gaze communication behaviours of neurotypical groups. These models are then trained and/or fine-tuned on datasets that involve neurotypical and ASD individuals and used for ASD diagnosis and severity prediction. Other potential applications of this tool include general human behaviour understanding, digital behaviour phenotyping and human-computer interaction.
<p align="justify"> <Strong>Biography:</Strong> Arcot Sowmya is Professor and Head of School, School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of New South Wales. She obtained her PhD in Computer Science and Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. Her research utilises and extends powerful techniques drawn from machine learning and pattern recognition and applies them to the complex problems of learning models for segmentation, classification, recognition and prediction in high-resolution images, including satellite and aerial images, medical images and multimodal datasets including omics data, and motion segmentation and classification in video images. Her research is supported by competitive and industry grants and has led to technology transfer to industry multiple times.
